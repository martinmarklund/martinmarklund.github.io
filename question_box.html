            <h2>FAQ</h2>
            <h3>What?</h3>
            <p>A digital representation of a box full of handwritten questions.</p>
            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>Because managing a physical question box is quite cumbersome.</p>
            <h3>No really, why?</h3>
            <p>Because we like to spice up the Friday stand-up meetings with a fun question answer.</p>
